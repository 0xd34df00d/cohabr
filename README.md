# cohabr

_cohabr_ is a scraper and web UI for the Habr.com site.
The aim is to keep backup versions of posts (cause they get deleted or modified), comments (cause they also get deleted),
as well as to provide a more mobile-friendly (and E Ink-friendly) UI.

For those familiar with sohabr (now discontinued), this is essentially its replacement (in fact, I started off the sohabr's DB dump).

This project is largely WIP. The scraper part is done and up and running, but the plans for the web UI are more vague.
If you feel like doing some web programming in Haskell, you're welcome to join!
